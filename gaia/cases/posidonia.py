Gaia v0.1 — Costa Brava Posidonia Meadow destruction case.

Marine ecosystem with 11 agents spanning the full web of biological and
physical dependencies: from the Posidonia meadow itself as foundation species,
through coralligenous reefs, fish nurseries, and apex megafauna, to the
coastal protection and tourism economy of the Costa Brava.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL: MARINE EXTERNALITY ECONOMICS — TIME-FLOW ASYMMETRY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In the forest case, private revenue is ongoing (per-tree timber income) and
externalities are one-time costs. Here the economics are INVERTED:

    Private revenue:    ONE-TIME gain from coastal development, marina
                        construction, or trawling permits that destroy
                        Posidonia (modeled as €2,500/ha destroyed).

    Externality costs:  ANNUAL RECURRING losses — every year the meadow
                        is gone, the ecosystem services are absent. The
                        report shows the annual cost rate; the true social
                        cost compounds every year the damage persists.

Payback arithmetic (at default parameters, full destruction):
    One-time revenue:   5,000 ha × €2,500 = €12,500,000
    Annual externality: ~€5,830,000/yr at full damage
    Payback period:     ~2.1 years — after that, society loses €5.8M/yr
                        every year, forever (Posidonia growth: 1-6 cm/year).

Over 10 years: €58.3M lost vs €12.5M gained (ratio: 4.7× against destruction).
Over 30 years: €174.9M lost vs €12.5M gained (ratio: 14× against destruction).

The simulation reports ANNUAL externality costs. A note in the output flags
this explicitly. NPV analysis over time horizons is a v0.5 feature.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Scientific context:
    Posidonia oceanica is one of the most biodiverse and carbon-rich ecosystems
    on Earth. It absorbs 15× more CO₂ per hectare than the Amazon rainforest and
    stores carbon in its sediment matte for millennia. Growth rate: 1-6 cm/year
    horizontal — any significant destruction is irreversible on human timescales.

    34% of Mediterranean Posidonia has been lost in the last 50 years. The Costa
    Brava is already under pressure from tourism infrastructure, boat anchoring,
    and residual trawling. The 20% safe threshold is lower than the forest (25%)
    because recovery is orders of magnitude slower and the ecosystem is already
    stressed.

    The Medes Islands MPA is the proof-of-concept: protected since 1983, fish
    biomass is 80× higher inside the reserve than outside. The science works —
    protection produces measurable, quantifiable recovery.

Parameter documentation (per ROADMAP.md Verification & Scientific Validation Strategy):

Monetary rates are back-calculated from user-specified max monetary impacts:
    rate = max_monetary_impact / dependency_weight
so that effective_max_per_agent = weight × rate = max_monetary_impact exactly.
